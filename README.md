() Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS), often called linear regression /n 
() Logistic regression (Binary, Ordinal, Multinomial, â€¦)  
() Nonlinear regression | 
() Log-linear regression (Poisson regression) (Poisson, Gamma or Exponential) is widely used to model scalar responses | 
() Quantile regression, flexible alternative to regression that estimates conditional quantiles of the dependent variable | 
() Nonparametric regression (Kernel and Lowess), used for prediction and is reliable even if hypotheses of linear regression are not verified | 
() Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), often used when there are a lot of explanatory variables, possibly correlated | 
() Principal Component Regression (PCR) combines PCA and OLS. It has advantages compared to classic regression. |
