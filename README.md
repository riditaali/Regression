# Regression

<> Linear regression <br />
<> Ordinary Least Squares regression (OLS), often called linear regression <br />
<> Logistic regression (Binary, Ordinal, Multinomial, â€¦) <br /> 
<> Nonlinear regression <br /> 
<> Log-linear regression (Poisson regression) (Poisson, Gamma or Exponential), widely used to model scalar responses <br /> 
<> Quantile regression, flexible alternative to regression that estimates conditional quantiles of the dependent variable <br /> 
<> Nonparametric regression (Kernel and Lowess), used for prediction and is reliable even if hypotheses of linear regression are not verified <br />  
<> Partial Least Squares regression (PLS), often used when there are a lot of explanatory variables, possibly correlated <br />   
<> Principal Component Regression (PCR) combines PCA and OLS. It has advantages compared to classic regression.
